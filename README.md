# Introduction 

This is CS20B075 and CS20B087's submission for Reinforcement Learning Programming Assignment 1. 

# Directory structure

CS6700___Reinforcement_Learning_PA1_Jan_May_2024_.pdf: contains the program description
GridWorld_PA1.ipynb: has the necessary code to run the experiments. 
GridWorld_PA1.pdf: PDF file of the ipynb file
GridWorld_PA1.ipynb: HTML file of the ipynb file (for a better viewing experience)
Report_Programming_Assignment_1.pdf: Our report on the experiments performed

# Replication

To replicate our experiments, simply run all the cells in the ipynb file. This would take about 1.5 hours to complete on a decent laptop. The images are generated within the Jupyter notebook and need to be copied out.
